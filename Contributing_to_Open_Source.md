In this documentation, we will explore a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to open source, including forking a repository, creating a new branch, making changes, creating a pull request, and more. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide will help you navigate the world of open source and make your first contribution.
## Install Git and Sign Up to Github üíª

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Git First Time Setup Instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

## Let's get Started üèÅ

Open the repository of the project that you want to contribute to.

### Fork the repository:
Click the **Fork** button on the repository's [GitHub](https://github.com/) page.

Once you have forked a repository, you will find the copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

Use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

### Create a new branch for your changes:

Use the `git checkout -b` command to create a new branch and switch to it:

```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Make changes to the code:

Make the desired changes to the codebase using your preferred text editor or IDE.

### Commit your changes:

Use the `git add` command to stage the changes and the `git commit` command to commit them with a descriptive message:

```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

### Push your changes to your forked repository:

Use the `git push` command to upload your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Create a pull request:

On your forked repository page, click the **New pull request** button. Select the branch you want to merge into the original repository's branch and provide a descriptive title and message for your pull request.


### Wait for review and feedback:

The repository's maintainers will **review** your changes and provide feedback if needed.

Be sure to respond to any feedback and make any requested changes to your code.

### Merge your changes:

Once your pull request has been approved, you can merge your changes into the original repository's branch by clicking the **Merge** button on your pull request page.

### And that's it! ‚úÖ

And that's it! You've successfully contributed to an open source project.
