# Guess the Number Challenge

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, we will create a simple game where the user has to guess a random number generated by the program. The program will give hints to the user if the guessed number is higher or lower than the random number. The user has to keep guessing until they correctly guess the number.

## Expected Result

The program should ask the user to enter their guess and provide hints until the user correctly guesses the random number. Once the user correctly guesses the number, the program should display a congratulatory message.

## Hints

1. The `Math.random()` function can be used to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
2. The `Math.floor()` function can be used to round down a decimal number to the nearest integer.
3. You can use the `prompt()` function to get input from the user.
4. Use a loop to keep asking the user to guess the number until they correctly guess it.

## Explanation

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` functions. It then starts a loop that will continue until the user correctly guesses the number. Inside the loop, the program uses the `prompt()` function to ask the user to enter their guess. It then checks whether the user's guess is higher, lower, or equal to the random number and provides hints accordingly. If the user correctly guesses the number, the program congratulates them and the loop ends.

```js
// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

// Initialize the user's guess to 0
let userGuess = 0;

// Loop until the user correctly guesses the number
while (userGuess !== randomNumber) {
  // Ask the user to enter their guess
  userGuess = Number(prompt("Guess a number between 1 and 100:"));

  // If the user's guess is higher than the random number, provide a hint
  if (userGuess > randomNumber) {
    console.log("Your guess is too high. Try again.");
  }
  // If the user's guess is lower than the random number, provide a hint
  else if (userGuess < randomNumber) {
    console.log("Your guess is too low. Try again.");
  }
  // If the user correctly guesses the number, congratulate them
  else {
    console.log("Congratulations! You guessed the number.");
  }
}
